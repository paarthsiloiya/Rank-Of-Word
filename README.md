# Rank-Of-Word

This is a simple project that lets you fing the "rank" of any word.

## What is Rank of a Word?

Let's take the word **CAT** for an example. So all the permutation of the word CAT with or without meaning are arranged in *alphabetical order* and the the position of the word CAT is known as the rank of the word CAT.

* ACT
* ATC
* **CAT**
* CTA
* TAC
* TCA

Therefore rank of the word cat is 3

## What is so special about this program then?

Now let's say the word **PYTHON** thus it has 6! = 720 permutations. So, it is not practical to write all of them down and find the rank of PYTHON

The sepciality about this program is it dosent just makes the entire dictionary with all the permutation and then finds the location of the word, because though efficent for smaller words but for larger words just making the dictionary with all the permutation will take a lot of computational time.

This program uses a compeletly mathematical approach to calculate this.

## Requirements:
there are no module requirements. just download the python file and run it.
